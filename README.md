# Racjin compression and decompression algorithms
In this repository you can find code for _compression_ and _decompression_ algorithms used in old PS2/PSP games by _Racjin_ (and other Japanese companies), such as 
* Naruto: Uzumaki Chronicles series (PS2)
* Fullmetal Alchemist 3 (PS2)
* Bleach: Soul Carnival 2 (PSP)
* Naruto Shippuden: Legends: Akatsuki Rising (PSP)
* Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact (PSP)
* and many others.  

Main contents of those games can be found in **CFC.DIG** files. [Here is the tool](https://github.com/Raw-man/Racjin-de-compression/releases/) for unpacking them. 

**Note**: 
>In Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Impact CFC.DIG files are encrypted and stored in PGD files so you need to decrypt them first;
>in Bomberman Kart Dx CDDATA.DIG files have a different structure.
